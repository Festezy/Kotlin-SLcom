    /**
     * So far we have seen functions that output a value.
     *
     * In some cases there is a need for a function to return a value, so that it can be assigned to a variable.
     * For example:
     * */

    var result = sum(8, 42)

    /**
     * For this, we need to define the return type for our sum function,
     * and use the return keyword to return the result:
     *
     * fun sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
     *     return (x+y)
     * }
     *
     * Our sum function now takes two Integer arguments and returns an Integer as the result.
     *
     * Note, that the return type is provided after the parentheses, but before the body of the function.
